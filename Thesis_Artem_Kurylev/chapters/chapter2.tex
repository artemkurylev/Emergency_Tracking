\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Deep Multi-Camera People Detection}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Problem}
        
        In article \cite{chavdarova2017deep} authors stated addressed the problem of multi-view occupancy map estimation.
        \item \textbf{Method}
        
        They used two stages: Firstly they used to train CNN on dataset with monocular view and then retain d of its layers, that results in some embedding  \[\mathit{\psi:} \mathit{I} \rightarrow \mathit{R^Q}\] where Q is number of output layer in dth layer. Then concatenation of C these embeddings is a multi-view embedding \[\psi: \mathit{I^C}\rightarrow R^{CQ}\]and on top of that embeddings binary classifier was trained. And finally, Non maxima suppression(NMS) algorithm was applied to select most appropriate candidates.
        
        \item \textbf{Conclusion}
        
        Authors proposed end-to-end deep learning  method for multi=view people detection, which outperforms state-of-the-art models of that time.
        \item \textbf{Performance}
        
        Authors used the following metrics for evaluating performance of the model: MODA (Multiple Object Detection Accuracy), MODP (Multiple object detection precision) Precision and Recall. Their best Results are presented in the table \ref{tab:deep}
        \\

        \end{center}
        
        \item \textbf{Strong Points}
        
        For the multiple views architecture of network presented in the article allows to parallelize computations. Authors also showed via their experiments that depth of the CNN as the feature extractor does not impact much on the result, so it allows to use shallower architectures.
        
        \item \textbf{Weak Points}
        
        The weakest point of the study is that even in PETS dataset, that was used for training and evaluating result, data was composed only from 8 views, that produces uncertainty about behavior of such system in case of using more views.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Monitoring Pedestrian Flow on Campus with Multiple Cameras using Computer Vision and Deep Learning Techniques}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Problem}
        In article \cite{monitoring2019} Authors stated problem of milticamera person re-identification and tracking across non-overlapping cameras
        \item \textbf{Method}
        Authors adopted Part-Based Convolution Baseline (PCB) \cite{sun2017models}. Idea of this method is about dividing received from backbone tensor into sub regions, where each sub region represents some part of body. Authors of the article proposed special weighted loss, which is calculated as following \[\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^p (w_i*l_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^p w_i} \] where $w_i$ corresponds to weight of each body part. They used DukeMTMC-reID\cite{zheng2017unlabeled} dataset for training and evaluating results.
        \item \textbf{Conclusion}
        Authors outperformed existing methods in Re-Identification task, and invented new weight loss adoption for the PCB approach. 
        \item \textbf{Performance}
        For evaluating Performance authors used two metrics - Rank-1 Accuracy and Mean Average precision(mAP). They are presented in the table \ref{tab:monitoringflow}

        \item \textbf{Weak points}
        Images from cameras include image from only one person and for the task of counting people there is need to have possibility to count multiple people from the single camera.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Locate, Size and Count: Accurately Resolving People in Dense Crowds via Detection}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Problem}
        Authors in \cite{sam2019locate} stated the problem of dense crowd people counting.
        \item \textbf{Method}
        Authors introduced new architecture LCS-CNN, which consists of three modules. First is feature extractor at multiple resolutions, second is Top Feature Modulator, where information from features is fused, and then predictions on bounding boxes are made, and the third one is NMS, where valid candidates are selected. For the training of the model last part was replaced by GWTA Loss module, which includes pixel wise information.   
        \item \textbf{Conclusion}
        Authors outperformed existing state-of-the art methods for people crowd counting, and introduced new specific method exactly for people crowd counting, especially for the dense ones.
        \item \textbf{Performance}
        Authors presented two metrics for evaluating results of their model: MAE and MSE on two datasets - ShanghaiTech(ST) Part A \cite{7780439} and UCF-QNRF dataset \cite{idrees2018composition}. They are presented in the table \ref{tab:locatesizecount}

    \item \textbf{DecideNet: Counting Varying Density Crowds Through Attention Guided Detection and Density Estimation}

        \item \textbf{Problem}
        Authors in \cite{liu2017decidenet} stated problem of crowd counting in both low density and not low density areas. They represent this problem as a density map estimation 
        \item \textbf{Method}
        First authors generated density map, using Gaussian kernel for ground truth head positions. Architecture consists of 3 parts - RegNet, which is nothing else but a CNN with 5 convolution, DetNet which is built upon R-CNN network, and Quality Net that get as input two density maps from first two blocks and original image. After forwarding through this part all three density maps are concatenated and then jointed into one with Hadamard product. Loss function is calculated for each of the parts with using of ground truth map

        Authors proposed robust framework for aggregating data from multiple cameras using HOG and LBP descriptors. Thier fusion method allows to handle occlusions and low visibility situations.
        \item \textbf{Performance}
        In article authors showed Recall and Precision metrics on PETS dataset around 0.9-1.
        \item \textbf{Strong points}
        System was actually deployed, and at the time it was presented it outperformed then methods. Also, it works with multi cameras.
        \item \textbf{Weak points}
        In this study there is no usage of modern CV algorithms(probably because they didn't exists at that time). Work shows good results, but it was not tested on really high density areas.

    \item \textbf{Human Count Estimation in High Density Crowd Images and Videos}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Problem}
        Authors in \cite{7913173} stated a problem of detecting and counting people at exceedingly swarmed crowd images and video scenes
        \item \textbf{Method}
        Proposed architecture consists of four parts  - Head detector, which uses HOG descriptors to detect actually heads, Fourier transform which is very useful in very highly dense cases, SIFT feature extractor and then combine all of them in a SVR (support vector regression algorithm)  Before all of these parts are applied image is divided into patches.
        \item \textbf{Conclusion}
        Authors proposed system for detecting and counting people in highly density crowd scenes. 
        \item \textbf{Performance}

        Results on the metrics are the following - MASE ~ 4 MSE ~ 10. 
        \item \textbf{Strong points}
        Authors used that system with not very powerful hardware which allows to adopt to us it probably in cameras themselves and used highly dense crowd images.
        \item \textbf{Weak points}
        Only one view was used, also dataset of 50 images is not really big one even with a lot of people presented on it and with augmentations that were applied.

        Authors introduced a head detector based on Dense Convolution network with specific Loss Calculations. In the most cases heads are presented by the only one pixel with coordinates \textit{[x,y]} and authors proposed usage of some Gaussian distribution around this point. Moreover this Gaussian calculation of a map depends on concrete head, and is calculated via this formula
        \[D(\mathbf{x},f(\cdot)) = \sum_i^N{\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}f\sigma_i}exp(-\dfrac{(\mathit{x} - \mathit{x_i})^2 + (\mathit{y}-\mathit{y_i})^2}{2f(\sigma_i)^2})}\]

        Proposed framework have possibility to deal with high density crowd images.
        \item \textbf{Performance}
        Evaluation of the model was made using UCF-QNRF dataset \cite{idrees2018composition}

        \item \textbf{Strong points}
        Proposed model is good for the tree task - localization, counting, density map estimation. for all of these three tasks model shows rich results 
        \item \textbf{Weak points}
        Use of only single image. Still, model is more appropriate for really high density crowds.
